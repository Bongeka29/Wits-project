##Assignment 5
#Chicken Weights
Null hypothesis: There will be no significant statistical difference between the groups
Alternarive hypothesis: There will be a sigificant statistical difference between the groups
Statistical test: One-way Anova
Assumptions:
1. Gaussian distribution
2. Equal Variances across the groups
3. Unpaired data 
4. Errors are independent
```{r, echo=TRUE}
data("chickwts")
boxplot(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
bar <- aov(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
summary(bar)
```
Interpretation of results:There is a significant statistical difference to show that the type of feed influeces growth rate.

#The Hot Zone
Null: There is no significant statitical difference between how much water the patients consumed and whether or not they became ill from it
Alternative: There is a significant statistical difference between how much contaminated water the patient drank and whether or not they became ill.
Statistical test: Chi squared test
Assumptions:
1. Randomn sampling
2. Independent observations
3. Large sample
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(readr)
gastroenteritis <- read.csv("C:/Users/Bongeka/Downloads/gastroenteritis.csv")
foo <- gastroenteritis
TAB<-table(foo$Consumption, foo$Outcome)
barplot(TAB)
chisq.test(TAB)
```
Interpretation of results:There is sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the amount of contamiated water the patient drank is not independent to the patient becoming ill. 

#NAUSEA
Null: The is no significant statistical difference between how the patients experienced nausea before and after chemotherapy 
Alternative: There is a significant statistical difference in how patients experienced nausea after chemotherapy.
Statisitical test: Paired Student T-TEST
Assumptions: 
1. Gausian distribution
2. Equal Variance
3. Errors are independent
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(readr)
nausea <- read_csv("C:/Users/Bongeka/Downloads/nausea.csv")
cols(
  Patient = col_integer(),
  Nausea_before = col_integer(),
  Nausea_after = col_integer()
)
boxplot(nausea$Nausea_before ~nausea$Nausea_after)

```

##Assigment 6
Null:
Alternative:
Test: Linear regression
Assumptions:
1.Linear trend between x and y
2.Observations in the sample are independent
3.x is measured without error
4.Residuals are normally distributed
5.Residuals have the same variance for all fo=itted values of y
```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(readr)
housing_prices <-read_csv("C:/Users/Bongeka/Downloads/housing-prices.csv")
mod <- lm(median_house_price_USD ~ interest_rate, data = housing_prices)
plot(mod)
summary(mod)
```
